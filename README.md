## Lab Purpose & Audience

This repo documents a homelab for practicing enterprise-scale identity and systems management. It demonstrates integration between on-prem Active Directory, Azure AD, and Microsoft 365.

## Quick Start

1. Review the Hybrid Lab Guide: [docs/lab_guide.md](docs/lab_guide.md)
2. Clone this repo and review the folder structure:
	- infra/ â€“ Terraform for cloud resources
	- scripts/ â€“ PowerShell setup scripts
	- docs/ â€“ Lab guide and documentation
	- diagrams/ â€“ Architecture diagrams
3. Follow the guide to set up:
	- Microsoft 365 tenant
	- Azure AD and on-prem AD
	- Windows Server and client VMs
	- File shares, GPOs, and SCCM

## Documentation

ðŸ“– [Hybrid Lab Guide](docs/lab_guide.md) â€“ step-by-step instructions to set up the lab.

- [Overview](docs/labs/overview.md)
- [Environment & Access](docs/labs/environment.md)
- [Exercise 1: Onâ€‘Prem AD Setup](docs/labs/ex1-ad-setup.md)

## Features

- On-prem Active Directory domain (lab.local) with OUs, groups, and Group Policies
- Azure AD + Microsoft 365 tenant sync via Azure AD Connect
- Windows 10/11 clients joined to the domain
- File shares with NTFS permissions and DFS namespaces/replication
- Application deployment with SCCM (ConfigMgr)
- Azure File Sync to OneDrive
- Office 365 services (Exchange Online, Teams, SharePoint Online) with SSO, MFA, and Conditional Access
- Security overlays: concepts for compliance (HIPAA, PCI), monitoring/logging, and SIEM (Sentinel/Splunk)

## Extensions (Planned)

- Terraform (AWS VPC + EC2) for cloud infrastructure automation
- Ansible for Windows configuration management
- Expanded Terraform to Azure IaaS resources
- Intune app deployment automation
- Splunk/Sentinel SIEM detection queries

## Why This Lab?

To practice:

- Hybrid identity management
- GPO and file share administration
- Application deployment and automation
- Cloud service integration (Office 365 + OneDrive)
- Security monitoring and compliance alignment

## Next Steps

- Expand Terraform to Azure IaaS resources
- Automate Intune app deployment
- Add Splunk/Sentinel SIEM detection queries

## Troubleshooting Tips

- Domain Join Issues: Verify the PC is joined to the domain and the user has the correct UPN suffix.
- O365 Sync Issues: Check if the account actually synced in Azure AD / O365. Run IdFix or review AD Connect sync logs.
- Mapped Drive Issues: Confirm the user is in the correct AD group. Verify NTFS and Share permissions match.
- Group Policy Missing: On the client, run `gpresult /r`. If policies arenâ€™t applying, use `gpupdate /force`.
